Introduction

This part of the document contains the mathematical formulation of MESSAGE. The
computer codes of the matrix generator produce equations according to this formulation, the
input data determine the form these equations actually take. In its general formulation
'MESSAGE is a dynamic linear programming model with a mixed integer option. This implies
'hat all relations that define the structure of a model are given as linear constraints between
continuous variables. The variables of such a model are called "Columns", the equations
Rows". This nomenclature is derived from the usual unit: notation used to write down linear
models: in the shape of a matrix.

'The variables (columns) of MESSAGE can be grouped into three categories:

#. Energy flow variables representing an annual energy flow quantity. The unit is usually
MWyr for small regions and GWyr for bigger areas,

#. Power variables representing the production capacity of a technology (usual unit: unit: MW
or GW), and

#. Stock-piles representing the quantity of a fuel being cumulated at a certain point in
time (usual unit: unit: MWyr or GWyr).

'The constraints (rows) generated by MESSAGE can be grouped into the following categories:

#. Energy flow balances modelling the flow of energy in the energy chain from resource
extraction via conversion, transport, distribution up to final utilization,

#. sum or relational constraints limiting aggregate activities on an annual or overall basis,
either absolute or in relation to other activities,

#. dynamic constraints setting a relation between the activities of two consecutive periods,
and
"Nonlinear constraints or a nonlinear objective function can only be defined for a specific problem, because
the nonlinear functions and, if possible, their first derivatives have to be supplied as FORTRAN subroutines for
